Adium Facebook Chat Toolbar Item Plugin
==========================

Adium plugin for displaying a button to open Facebook chats in Safari

<i>Do you chat with Facebook chat?

Do you use Adium for that?

Have you ever needed to open Facebook in browser for viewing an image or the chat history?

Did you ever complain, why is that chat so many clicks away?</i>

If the ansers are yes, this plugin is for you. It adds a new button to the Adium chat window toolbar, which leads you directly there. Yes, it is 1 click away now. :)

# Use
